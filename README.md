Project Description
While building this GitHub clone, I aimed to complete it quickly while still trying to make it resemble the original as closely as possible. The project was developed using only HTML and CSS.
If I had more time, I would have integrated real links into the elements. That way, clicking on each section would redirect you to the corresponding GitHub page. However, due to time constraints, I wasnâ€™t able to implement those features.![github-clone](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2e38520-b39d-446e-8cc6-86656dc65ea6)
